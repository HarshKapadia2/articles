So I had an awesome opportunity to interview [Jason Mayes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/creativetech/), a Senior Developer Advocate for [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) at Google, with my friend [Anushka Bhagchandani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anushka-bhagchandani-07659618b/)! The webinar had about 100 attendees in total! 

We talked about his journey into the industry, his current role in the TensorFlow.js team, his mindset and attitude in life and much more!

This is a summary of the interview.

# Journey

Before Jason sir could enroll himself into a University, he had to take a gap year and work at a networking job in a school to earn money for his tuition. After that, he enrolled himself for a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Bristol.

After graduating in 2008, he got a job at a bank, but quit on the first day itself as he realised that that was not the environment he wanted to work in. He then joined 'XMOS Semiconductors Ltd' as a Web Engineer. This is where he did a lot of design, UX, multimedia productions, 3D modelling, photography and much more, along with Web Engineering. He said that he was definitely scared of the decision of quitting his job at the bank, but he was glad that he did that, because it led to him learning a LOT of things! So he said that sometimes one has to take scary decisions for themselves, no matter what.

While working at XMOS, he co-founded his own startup called 'Pure42' which catered to the web application and design sector. He worked for XMOS from 9 am to 5 pm and from 5 pm to 11 pm for Pure42. He combined his passion for creativity with his more technical Computer Science background to produce usable and well implemented digital solutions.

Just as he was about to quit his job at XMOS and work at Pure42 full-time, he realised that Google had an interest in him. He had never planned to work at Google! A [Googler](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Googler) had found him because of the good [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) that his web site [jasonmayes.com](http://jasonmayes.com/) had. In the early days of his career, he made a lot of web applications for free and for charities. He also wrote some articles which he linked to his web site [jasonmayes.com](http://jasonmayes.com/). This increased the PageRank of his web site and his web site was one of the top results in the 'Web Consultant' section of Bristol.

He was very surprised at being approached for an interview at Google and he decided to take it as an opportunity to practice his interview skills, because he thought that he would never get into Google! He prepared some stuff on Data Structures and Algorithms and also brushed up on some of the Computer Science knowledge that he had learnt in his University days. He told us that he was just geeking out about technology, something that he was passionate about, with his interviewers and he felt that it came across as more natural and confident to them. He was a hybrid developer (technical + creative) and loved building full-stack applications combining different industries. This was another reason he stood out from the others.

He joined Google in 2011 as a 'Web Engineer' and has been there ever since! His coding skills really developed a lot there and he became better at writing good, neat and performant code. He loved JavaScript and he was at that role for about five and a half years! At that time, he had joined a '20% project' programme at Google, where he could take one day off in a week to work on something that he was passionate about. Over time, his prototypes got really interesting and he started working with other teams at Google and their clients in that 20% time for making cool things! His love for prototypes is what led him to join his second team at Google, the 'ZOO' team, for about three to four years. This team catered to Google's top 100 clients! He worked on a lot of different and new technologies to create really cool and awesome prototypes, that he wasn't able to do at his previous position. He experimented with Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Machine Learning (ML), etc. He had started tinkering with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and his love for it kept growing. He was looking for ways in which he could combine his love for JavaScript and AI and this is how he landed a place at his third team at Google in December 2019, the TensorFlow.js (TF.js) team. TF.js is the [JavaScript version](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) of the [original TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). He is the face of the TF.js team and a connection between the users and the developers of TF.js. He also makes a lot of prototypes using a combination of TF.js and other cool technologies!

# TensorFlow.js Demos

## Real-time Person Removal

Removing people from complex backgrounds in real-time using TensorFlow.js in the web browser using JavaScript. This code attempts to learn over time the makeup of the background of a video such that I can attempt to remove any humans from the scene. This is all happening in real time, in the browser, using TensorFlow.js.

## Real-time Clothing Size Estimator

This experiment attempts to use machine learning in the web browser via a pre-trained TensorFlow.js model called [BodyPix](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/body-pix) such that we can then estimate a user's key body measurements allowing them to discover their size on a fashion website when typically sizes differ from brand to brand. This proof of concept shows that reasonable accurate measurements are possible in seconds via the web with no need to download and install any apps as everything is written in JavaScript.

## Teachable Machine

A fast, easy way to create machine learning models for web sites, apps, and more â€“ no expertise or coding required.

Check it out [here](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)!

Teachable Machine makes it very simple to create an AI model! You can have a good model in 30 seconds! It is a GREAT way to get started with machine learning!

# Questionnaire

The following are a mixture of some of the questions that we had prepared and a few of the questions that the attendees had asked.

## How do you get innovative ideas for your prototypes?

Sir said that the teleportation demo (showcased above) came to him in his dream! He had the idea and he just tried to convert it into reality! He added that it started out very simply with body segmentation model. He made the invisibility demo (showcased above) using that and then that demo evolved to the teleportation demo by adding more technologies to it! So he said that he often started with simpler ideas and then eventually ideas grew on top of existing ideas that led him to make more prototypes.

Another good way to get ideas according to him, is to try and solve problems that you or other people are facing in day-to-day life. He made the clothing size estimator demo (showcased above) because he isn't good at buying clothes and he just wanted to make the process simpler for himself!

## How can one get started with AI?

Jason sir believes in a top-down approach, sort of like peeling an onion from the outer layers to the core. First applying a technology and understanding the higher level things is always helpful for when you start digging deeper into a technology to understand its working or/and to build something from scratch. This also lowers the barrier of entering the domain as sometimes the initial frustration of learning too many things is what drives away a lot of people. This is true for almost all technology domains.

The rough path according to sir should be something like this:
- Start with [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/). You can have a good model in 30 seconds! All beginners should experiment with Teachable Machine and use it for their own applications, get to know its limitations and then go deeper into AI.
- Use pre-trained models, like [the ones that TF.js has](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models). (The TF.js pre-trained models are also available on their [Codepen](http://codepen.io/topic/tensorflow) and [Glitch](http://glitch.com/@TensorFlowJS) accounts.)
- [Cloud AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/automl/) could be the next step. (Better for production applications as the amount of training data that can be given is way more and there are many other functions as well.)
- Then you could take some higher level courses (ie, the ones that deal more with the application than the underlying things).
- Last but not the least, take some lower level courses (ie, the ones that go deeper into the mathematics and other concepts).

Sir recommended a book [Deep Learning with JavaScript](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-javascript) that is made by the TF.js and the TF (Python) team, which beginners can use to get started.

## Would you want upcoming developers to specialize in a particular field only or have a more hybrid background like you do?

Sir said that one should first specialize in learning the basics of programming (good coding practices, learning to write maintainable, secure and scalable code, basic concepts and syntax of the language of your choice, etc). After that, the technology domain has a LOT of domains to explore, so you should explore a few of them (you don't need to go in too deep) to find out where your interests lie and then learn maybe two or three of them.

According to sir, very few people know how to combine different technologies and industries together, so once you have a knowledge in some domains or different industries, you can combine them to create something unique! It can be a combination of your hobby and your tech domain as well! So if you say that you're 'Passionate about ML for Music creation' rather than 'A ML enthusiast', you stand out over the others.

So you should have a combination of things that you love and some higher level knowledge in other areas, so that you can cherry pick things as and when required!

## What is the importance of networking?

Sir said that networking at times is more important than your degree. The degree and the marks are required to pass the interview, but sometimes you might not get the interview without knowing the person who is hiring. It can be an introduction to you and they can then interview you because they come to know that you exist.

In sir's case, Google came to know about him only because he wrote a lot of stuff for blogs and magazines (which in turn increased the PageRank of his website as he had linked the blogs to his website). He also did a lot of charitable work, which helped him grow his network by word-of-mouth, which goes a long way! (So good can come from being good!)

## When should people start building their profile? (LinkedIn profile and personal portfolio web site.)

Right off the bat, sir said that if you're serious about programming, you should already have a portfolio web site. If not, then get on it! Make sure to have your Codepen, GitHub or other profiles that show the coding standards that you live up to, ready. (You can refer to [Google's style guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/) for various languages as well.)

Also, apart from being innovative, creative and having good documentation, your code should be neat and well formatted as well.

## From your experience in the technology industry and life in general, what would be your advice to others to become successful?

Being curious and exploring your curiosities! He said that too often people have an idea and they think about it for a little bit, but never end up working on it. The most difficult thing is the start of a project. The momentum of the idea can be maintained once it's implementation has started, but the initial inertia needs to be overcome.

He then suggested everyone to devote at least an hour of their day, either after college or work/job to work on their ideas. He ended his point with "Just do it!"

He also added that a lot of people did not see the other side of the cool projects. There was a lot of hard work that went into them. A lot of times, there were failures and problems and perseverance is SO important in those cases! It can take time, maybe hours, weeks or even months, but he told us to just keep at it!

Don't let anyone tell you that you can't do it. If you're not where you want to be, then keep at it till you achieve it. Don't give up! Stick at it and if it's taking a lot of time, then you can keep it on the back-burner, but do come back to it soon.

To summarise, stay curious, persevere and be pro-active.

## What should one do if they have an idea, but do not have the skills to implement it?

- Design sprinting is one way to go about it, wherein you have to make a prototype within a week. (Not necessarily a working one, it can be a simple mockup as well!)
- He said that it is a good thing to know which skill you don't know.
- The idea can be stolen (and an idea cannot be patented). You can also sign NDAs with people, but asking trusted people is the best way to move forward.
- You can include some trusted people with the required skills in your team or learn some of them yourself.

## You are a very busy person, so how do you maintain a work-life balance?

Time management plays a big role in his work-life balance.

He also told us about the importance of [deep work](https://medium.com/designing-atlassian/deep-work-3cd27b5fd0f9) here. He said that we humans require about fifteen minutes to get into a proper working state and if we do not allocate time properly, then effective work (deep work) is not possible.

He gets a lot of e-mails and answering them is not deep work. So, he allocates 2 hours a day for them, one at the beginning of his day and one at the end. This gives him a good chunk of six hours in the middle of his eight working hours to do proper undisturbed work and the two separate hours for e-mails also cover different time zones for communication purposes. If something urgent had come up, someone would call you, disturb you via chat or any other means.

So allocation of time into chunks of work and rest is what helps him maintain a proper balance. "You get better at that with experience.", is what he ended with.

## How do you approach failures?

Sir said that things don't always work out and the key thing is to approach the problem positively and see it as a learning experience. Understand what can be improved in the future so you don't fail again. So analyse the failure, work on it and learn from it.

## Would you change anything in your journey? Do you have any regrets?

The immediate reply was that if he changed anything, he would not be where he is today.

He said that he didn't regret anything and thoroughly enjoyed his time working in startups! He then added that he would highly recommend people to explore startups, especially when they're younger, because they have lesser commitments then and have family and financial backing as well. As you grow older these things start to matter and so working for a bigger company is better, because you have stable income. With a startup, you learn a lot and if you mess up, the consequences are very real, so the added responsibility makes you learn a lot very fast. These learnings can then be applied to bigger companies as well, because you might tend to use lesser resources which saves the company money and might improve their performance as well, apart from other reasons.

He prefers going from a startup to a large company and not vice versa, because if one directly started at Google, they would already have all the freebies and backup plans before experiencing the hardships that one faces at startups.

## How can someone find their calling?

His reply was that if what you're doing feels like work, then it is not what you should be doing. Do something that you enjoy, combine your passions and find something that allows you to do that full-time. (Eg: JavaScript and AI, as in Jason sir's case.)

All the demos that he had made, were made in his spare time, ie, on the weekends, as it didn't feel like work to him (even though it was sort of his job to create them) and he would've made them even if he wasn't in the role that he currently is (Senior Developer Advocate for TF.js at Google). Also, it took him five and a half years after starting to work for Google to find the correct team to be in (the ZOO team) so that he could make prototypes for 100% of his time, that he had already been making in his 20% time for the past years! It takes perseverance to find the right opportunity and teams and then to prove your worth. So a combination of skills would make you stand out more (Eg: 'JavaScript lover with expertise in music applications' is better than 'JavaScript lover' or 'Software Engineer').

So that was the summary of all the important questions! I hope you got an insight into Jason sir's mind! Do share this article if you liked it!
