# Chirag Nayyar on Getting Started with Cloud.

I had a really good talk with [Chirag Nayyar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiragnayyar/) sir on how beginners can get started with Cloud.

I learnt a lot in the two hour session, so I summarized the key points into a two minute read.

# Getting Started with Cloud

Sir strongly believes in a bottom to top approach.

- Focus on the fundamentals
   - Networking
   - Relational Databases (SQL)
   - Storage
   - Compute
- Choose ANY Cloud Platform. (They all have a generous free tier.)
- Explore the platform.
- Understand their services. (Co-relate with your foundational knowledge.)
- Buy a domain.
- Make a portfolio.

# Important Concepts

- Networking
- Relational Databases (SQL)
- Storage
- Compute
- Virtualization (Need & role)
- Understand '[Software Defined Everything](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/software-defined_everything.html)'.
- Know the purposes of services.

# General Tips

- Don't follow too many resources.
- Build a strong foundation.
- Grow step by step.
- Nothing is a race.
- Build things that you like and try to test them in other environments.
- Try and fail as soon as possible.
- Share your learning with the community.
- Own a domain and an e-mail with it.
- Your portfolio site does not have to be the most beautiful one out there.
- Put a target date (may be months).
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are gold mines.
- Certifications don't matter. Only the official ones matter and in the case of cloud they have a certain validity, so do them at the right time and use them properly. Learn, don't run after certificates.
